% yearday -- Convert date to year and day-of-year.
%  yearday(theDate) returns [year day], where the day
%   is a decimal date-number.  The given date can be
%   a Matlab datenum, datestr, or datevec.
%  yearday([theYear theDay]) returns the Matlab datenum
%   corresponding to theYear and theDay.
%  yearday(theYear, theDay) same as above.
%  yearday (no arguments) demonstrates itself by showing
%   a round-trip, using "now".
