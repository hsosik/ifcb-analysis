% D. Catlett 2022 - aggregates NES broadscale data spatially using a
% hierarchical clustering procedure based on geographic distances between
% ifcb samples. Goal is to smooth data for inspection of large-scale
% abundance, etc distributions
% it does this:
% (1) computes a pairwise great-circle-distance matrix between each
% discrete sample
% (2) places samples into geographic clusters using the 'average' linkage 
% method (see MATLAB's built-in linkage function for details) and the
% distthresh input argument
% (3) attempts to merge geographic clusters from (2) so that a minimum of
% volthresh volume has been sampled, under the constraint that clusters
% with centroids > centdistthresh km apart are not merged
% 
% INPUTS:
% (1) counts = count vector or matrix
% (2) vol = volume sampled
% (3) lat = latitude sampled
% (4) lon = longitude sampled
% (5) distthresh = distance threshold (km) for initial cluster generation
% (6) centdistthresh = distance threshold (km) for post-cluster merging
% (7) volthresh = volume threshold (ml) that the post-cluster merging
% attempts to satisfy for all clusters
% 
% OUTPUTS: 
% (1) pooled_ct = vector or matrix of pooled counts
% (2) pooled_meta = avg values of meta-data for pooled counts provided in a
% table array
% (3) clust_key1 = a numeric vector with corresponding cluster id's
% for each sample generated from the initial geographic clustering 
% (4) clust_key_mod = a numeric vector with corresponding cluster id's for
% each sample after both clustering and post-cluster merging
