C = abs(B-A)/2; % gives the radius of each A,B pair OR half the height of the perimeter at each x location

vol = C.^2*pi*1; % calculates the volume of each cyclindrical slice; the 1 represents the width in the x-direction, which is 1 pixel
volume = sum(vol); % sums vol to get the overall volume of the figure
